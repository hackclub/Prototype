# Submitting your Prototype project!

### In your README.md (in order):

-   Name of your project
-   Team name + Team Number + GitHub Usernames of your teammates
-   Picture of your project
-   Description of your project!
-   A full video demo of your project working!
-   Anything else you'd like to add!
-   MORE PICTURES!!!

### In your repository:

-   ALL 3D models used in .STEP format (unless they were made in tinkercad)
-   there is a mission directory that contains your weights

## The `mission` folder

Here's an example repo provided by AMD!

https://github.com/AlexHe99/AMD_Robotics_Hackathon_2025_ProjectTemplate

Directory tree of an example repo, you need to fill in the `mission` directory with your submission details.

```
AMD_Robotics_Hackathon_2025_ProjectTemplate-main/
├── README.md
└── mission
├── code
│ └── <code and script>
└── wandb
└── <latest run directory copied from wandb of your training job>
```

The latest-run is generated by wandb for your training job. Please copy it into the wandb sub directory of you Hackathon Repo.

The whole dir of latest-run will look like below:

```
$ tree outputs/train/smolvla_so101_2cube_30k_steps/wandb/
outputs/train/smolvla_so101_2cube_30k_steps/wandb/

NOTES

The latest-run is the soft link, please make sure to copy the real target directory it linked with all sub dirs and files.
Only provide (upload) the wandb of your last success pre-trained model for the Mission.

## Submission form

The submission form will be available here closer to the submission deadline.
