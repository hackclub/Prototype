# 3D printing at hackathons!

Hey there! This is a quick list of pointers for 3D printing at events

1. **Print only what you need to print** \
   This is THe
2. **Avoid supports** \
   Supports take a LONG time to print! For functional prints, you are almost _always_ able to orient them
3. \*\*Check
