# Hardware!

In order to get hardware, you _must_ register your team of 3. Fill out the following form if you haven't already:

https://forms.hackclub.com/prototype-team-signup

Once that's done, here's how you get hardware!!

## Step 1: Wait for the hardware station to open!

Hardware will only be handed out during designated windows! The station be open from 7PM to 1AM on the first night, and then in 30 minute windows afterwards. You can check the schedule here:

hack.club/prototype-schedule

When the hardware station is closed, please DO NOT do any of the following:

-   get hardware on your own
-   ask other staff to grab hardware from you
-   steal from other teams

This ensures that we know what items are where when we need it!

The password to the table is `i will definitely not steal hardware`

## Step 2: Wait for your order to be logged

Once you're at the hardware station, ask for whatever hardware you need! Everyone at the table is an expert at hardware and can give you guidance on what you may need.

Before giving you the hardware, the organizer helping you will quickly log your order - they'll ask for your team name and write it down.

It is very important you wait for them to finish before walking away with hardware! This ensures we have enough hardware for everyone!

## Step 3: Repeat!

After that, you're done! If you need more hardware, repeat the steps above

If you no longer need hardware, please return it to a staff member! It'll help other people build their projects :)

Happy hacking!
