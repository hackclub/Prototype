1. QuickStart for setting up LeRobot Development Environment with AMD Edge ROCm platform.

   [QuickStart.md](QuickStart.md)
  
2. Request a training environment with an AMD MI300X GPU by going to the provided link (link will only be available during the Hackathon and requires authorization).
   The process will take a few minutes to provision the GPU instance and open a [Jupyter Notebook](training-models-on-rocm.ipynb) for environment configuration and model training.  

3. Check the guide to set up the robot ARMs:
